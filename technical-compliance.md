Technical Compliance (Nigeria 2025 context)

For the developers to keep in mind during the build:

    NIMC Integration: The UI should support the vNIN (Virtual NIN) input flow, ensuring clear instructions that privacy is maintained via NIMC's tokenized system.

    Evidence Act Support: The "Finalized" screen must offer a one-click generation of the Section 84 Certificate of Authenticity (metadata log).

    Local Residency: Ensure all frontend telemetry or metadata APIs point to Nigerian IP blocks (e.g., hosted on MainOne/Rack Centre).
